1. Data cleaning
  e.g. we use openpose to label the data, but sometimes, the label is wrong.
  or there is no person in the image at all. All these images needed to be delete before training.
  solution: we only use the images all 6 keypoints(nose, neck, shoulders, eyes) are detected sucessfully.

2. Learning rate adjustment strategy
  At first, it can be 0.00025, and after some iterations, e.g. 100000, it can be smaller 0.0001
  
3. Flip operation
  Pay attention to the eyes order. We can visualize by imshow in a loop.
  
4. Model freeze
  Use tf_graph_tool.py shell to freeze the model(.meta, checkpoint, .index) into one .pb file.

5.Evaluation methods
  Select the test sets and the methods. If detected all the six joints, nums_detected_right += 1
  Accuracy is another feature that can be used.
  
6. Batchsize num and other parameters
