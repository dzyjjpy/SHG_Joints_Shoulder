1. Base 502000.pb, no train on the new dataset
   6 joints detection rate: 88%

2. training 105000 iter, using 4w images, with eyes order issue
  test_1000: 82.7%
  if we use 1000 images in training sets, results as below(try three times)
  83.3% V194.8% V286.7%
  
3. Loss gap 
  Train loss and Val loss is strange. Val is about 3 times than Train loss.
  After 10000+ iterations, the val loss drop, then little bigger than train loss
  train loss: between 3-5, val loss: between 3.8-6.8, after 30000+ it goes up.
  Totally, the total loss goes down.
  
  we train three version:
  (1)no pre trained, we use 502000.pb
     Model 25000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  90.90% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  95.90%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 92.00%
     Model 90000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.00% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  %
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 94.5%
  (2)use preModel 105000.pb, train on 4w+ cleaned images(accuracy: 82.7% on Test_1000)
     Model 80000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.10% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  97.10%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 94.1%
  (3)use preModel 105000.pb, train on 4w+ cleaned images(accuracy: 82.7% on Test_1000) V3
     version2, to make a comparision with(2)
