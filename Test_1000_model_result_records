0.How to choose the test datasets?
   Test_1000: including 1000 images, not loop in training process
   Train_1000:  select 1000 images randomly in training sets
   Train_1000_V2: select 1000 images randomly in training sets again
   Train_5000: including 5741 images in training sets

1. Base 502000.pb, no train on the new dataset
   6 joints detection rate 
   test_1000: 88%
   train_5000: 83.10%

2. Training 105000 iterations based on 502000.pb, using 4w images(detect 6 joints, data cleaned), with eyes order issue
  test_1000: 82.7%
  if we use 1000 images in training sets, results as below(try three times)
  test_1000(V0) accuracy: 83.3% 
  train_1000(V1) accuracy: 94.8%  
  train_1000_V2 accuracy: 86.7%
  
3. Loss gap 
  Train loss and Val loss is strange. Val is about 3 times than Train loss.
  After 10000+ iterations, the val loss drop, then little bigger than train loss
  train loss: between 3-5, val loss: between 3.8-6.8, after 30000+ it goes up.
  Totally, the total loss goes down.

4. Test performance result records
  we train three version, training sets including 4w images.
  (1) no pretrained, train the model based on 502000.pb dirctly
  (2) train the model based on 105000.pb， V2， was killed accidently, only to 80000+ iterations
  (3) train the model based on 105000.pb, V3
  (1)no pre trained, we use 502000.pb
     Model 25000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  90.90% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  95.90%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 92.00%
         train_5000 accuracy: 95.56%
     Model 90000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.00% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  97.20%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 94.5%
         train_5000 accuracy: 97.07%
     Model 120000.pb(latest trained version)
         test_1000 accuracy:  94.1% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  TBC%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: TBC%
         train_5000 accuracy: 96.74%
  (2)use preModel 105000.pb, train on 4w+ cleaned images(accuracy: 82.7% on Test_1000), was ended ?80000+ steps
     Model 80000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.10% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  97.10%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 94.10%
         train_5000 accuracy: 97.00%
  (3)use preModel 105000.pb, train on 4w+ cleaned images(accuracy: 82.7% on Test_1000) V3
     version2, to make a comparision with(2)
     Model 80000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.70% 
         train_1000 accuracy: 96.60%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 95.00%
         train_5000 accuracy:   96.93%
     Model 90000.pb
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.6% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  96.70%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: 94.90%
         train_5000 accuracy: 97.11%
     Model 120000.pb(best performance, so next training's premodel)
         test_1000 accuracy:  95.60% 
         train_1000 accuracy:  TBC%
         train_1000_V2 accuracy: TBC%
         train_5000 accuracy: 97.33%
         
Conclusion
   From the above records, we can easily know that 
   (1)More iterations and data clean are key to improve the performance.
